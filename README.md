# PomoTaskV1.0

## Description:

This is the first version of our project of a Pomodoro Application with a Todo Task Tracker.  

In this first version we are going to create two interfaces, that will later on be merged into one.  

The user can run the code to add tasks or see their progress, or they can use the pomodoro to track their time.

## Tasks:

A task has the following structure:
- Project
    - Task

## TASK INTERFACE

I have hard coded the opening of the file in the init to test how the spinbox works.  

So now the user can either add a new project or choose from one of his previous tasks.   

He can not choose the two options one must be left blank.

If he create a new task the fields for new task and new project are clean up the selection for project in the spinbox is not.

I'm considering using a Text so he can add multiple tasks at once.
