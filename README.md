# PomoTaskV1.0

## Description:

This is the first version of our project of a Pomodoro Application with a Todo Task Tracker.  

In this first version we are going to create two interfaces, that will later on be merged into one.  

The user can run the code to add tasks or see their progress, or they can use the pomodoro to track their time.

## Tasks:

A task has the following structure:
- Project
    - Task

## TASK INTERFACE

## JSON FILE
I have created a json file with the structure I want for the .json file for the data. The duration is in minutes and is an integer always.
